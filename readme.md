# OkCorgi Revisited

#### We're going to build on our OkCorgi app from earlier in the week - but this time, we're going to save our results!
- Using the code already provided, make it so that when a Corgi is skipped or picked, that data is saved on the "match" column in the database
- When a user goes to the home page, they should see their previous skips or matches already in the correct columns

__BONUS__: Add drag-and-drop functionality so that in addition to "pawing" with buttons, users can skip or match by dropping Corgis into the appropriate side of the screen (left for skip, right for match)

__DOUBLE BONUS__: Create a form on the home page for users to add new Corgis to the mix without reloading the page!
